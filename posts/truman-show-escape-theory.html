    <p>The Truman Show is often interpreted as a narrative of gradual awakening—a story of an innocent man uncovering the falsehoods surrounding his life. However, an alternative reading reveals a more subversive possibility: that Truman Burbank is not naive, but rather strategically aware. Instead of slowly discovering the artificiality of his world, he may have long suspected it, choosing to mask his awareness in order to safely navigate a constructed environment until escape becomes possible.

This interpretation shifts Truman’s arc from passive realization to active resistance. Rather than unraveling under the weight of revelation, Truman’s behavior can be seen as deliberate, measured, and performative—characteristics aligned more with subtle rebellion than with ignorance.</p>
